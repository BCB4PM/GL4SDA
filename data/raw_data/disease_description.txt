It can range from mild to severe, affecting different joints asymmetrically or symmetrically. Nail changes and dactylitis are common features. The condition may involve spondylitis, leading to back and neck pain. Arthritis mutilans is a severe, rare form causing joint deformation. Psoriatic arthritis is diagnosed through physical exams and imaging tests, with treatments focusing on controlling inflammation and pain. It is associated with an autoimmune basis and has a strong genetic component."
56,DOID:7148,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease primarily affecting joints, characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness. It commonly involves small joints in the hands and feet, progressing to larger joints. Symptoms typically appear in mid- to late adulthood, with flares and remissions. The disease can also affect other tissues and organs, causing fatigue, weight loss, and anemia. Rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformity and disability if left untreated. Treatments include medication, lifestyle changes, and surgery to manage pain and reduce joint damage. The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but factors like genes, environment, and hormones may contribute."
57,DOID:1115,"Sarcoma is a malignant tumor that originates from mesenchymal cells, which are part of connective tissue. This type of cancer can arise from various types of connective tissues, leading to different subtypes of sarcoma based on the tissue and cell type of origin. Sarcoma is characterized by abnormally proliferating cells that come from embryonic mesoderm."
58,DOID:9074,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against various molecules, leading to inflammation and organ damage. Symptoms include joint pain, skin rashes, fatigue, and kidney problems. SLE can affect multiple organs, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. It is marked by periods of exacerbation and remission, with potential life-threatening complications over time. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation throughout the body, with symptoms varying in severity. Early diagnosis and treatment by a rheumatologist are crucial."
59,DOID:399,"Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a contagious disease that primarily affects the lungs but can also target other body parts like the kidneys, spine, and brain. Most infections are asymptomatic, known as latent TB, but can progress to active disease in about 10% of cases. Symptoms of active TB include chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. TB is transmitted through droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If left untreated, TB disease can be fatal, but it can be cured with antibiotics."
60,DOID:13223,"Uterine leiomyoma, also known as fibroids, are benign tumors of the uterine myometrium, prevalent in women of reproductive age. Symptoms may include heavy periods, infertility, pelvic pain, and complications during pregnancy. Fibroids are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the US. They are muscle cell and tissue growths in the uterus, with unknown causes. Risk factors include being African American or overweight. Symptoms can include heavy bleeding, frequent urination, pain during sex, and lower back pain. Treatment options include drugs to slow growth or surgery, but many women with fibroids may not require treatment. Fibroids can impact fertility, but infertility treatments are available."
61,DOID:11165,"Common wart is a viral infectious disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 1, 2, 4, 27, and 57. It results in raised warts with a rough surface, commonly found on hands but can grow anywhere on the body. These warts are papillomatous, keratinous growths that can affect any part of the skin and adjacent mucous epithelia, and are prevalent during childhood and adolescence."
62,DOID:2366,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic, single-stranded RNA flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. It was first isolated in 1937 and emerged in Europe and New York in 1999, spreading throughout North America. WNV causes a range of diseases from fever to lethal encephalitis, with increased susceptibility in the elderly and immunocompromised. The virus is part of the Flaviviridae family and primarily affects birds, maintaining a transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes. Humans and horses can exhibit symptoms, including fever, headache, body aches, and skin rash. Severe cases can lead to life-threatening brain inflammation. Prevention involves avoiding mosquito bites through repellent use, eliminating breeding sites, and staying indoors during peak mosquito activity."
